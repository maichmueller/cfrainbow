# <p align=left> CFRainbow: <i>Counterfactual Regret Minimization</i> Implementations Of Various Shapes & Colors

CFRainbow provides implementations of the basic CFR algorithm and some of the improved variants of CFR
for computing <b>Nash Equilibria</b> in the 2-player 0-sum case as well as <b>Correlated Equilibria</b> in the general-sum case. 
The pacakge is loosely built for modularity and general applicability, 
not performance, and integrates into the Openspiel framework by Deepmind.
